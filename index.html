                    Hello, my name is Rosemarie Noonan. I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from Governors State University in May of 2022. I am very passionate 
                      about technology, and I am always striving to learn new skills and languages in the various fields under the technology umbrella. One skill I am actually working on and picked 
                      up on my own is HTML! This webpage is both a test of those skills, a learning experience, and a resume site for anyone looking to learn a little bit more about me. Some things I 
                      want to work more on, that I have only been introduced to slightly include; Linux, Python, PHP, and databases. 
                </p1>

  <h3 class="card-title" align-items="left">Life growing up
</h3>

  <p1 class="body"> As a child, I was raised to explore. For the longest time technology was not a part of my family's life. Growing up we had one home phone and old computers with Window's XP that 
      were primarily used by my siblings to play CD ROM games that never involved the internet. We had one home phone, that was corded to the wall, and the only numbers we had were for our close family,
       like my mother, father, and grandmother. In fact, I didn't get my first computer until my freshman year of high school, and my first basic smartphone came a few years later. So hobbies that I
        picked up over the years taught me a little about everything. Gardening, photography, woodworking, car repair, you name it. It wasn't until I entered high school that my passion for technology 
        really took off. Starting off I was in a computer hardware repair class, and the feeling of taking everything apart and seeing how all the pieces worked together had me hooked. The passion 
        spiraled into Computer Software, Linux, personal PC builds, Networking, CyberSecurity, and Website Design. There really was no stopping me, and the same could still be said today, I am always 
        looking for new subjects in technology to explore, and learn. All of these things may seem overwhelming, but that is what I love about technology, watching how it continuously evolves over the 
        years and becomes more streamlined, and what once was a twenty-pound laptop that couldn't stray far from an outlet is now a mere pound or two and can go days without a recharge.
